1.  Regular expressions

Regular expressions are a powerful way of scanning lines of text and
selecting parts thereof based on pattern specifictions.

In C++, the facility is made available via <regex>.

https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/

2.  https://regexr.com/

https://regexr.com/ has an interactive page to learn about regular
expressions.

3.  Raw strings

Raw strings are a way of writing string constants without the need to
escape escapes.  For example, the string "\\\"\t\n" represents a
backslash, a quote, a tab, and a newline.

But regexes are represented as strings, and use backslashes for a
separate semantic reason.  To avoid having to double every backslash,
a raw string can be used.  This is denoted by placing the letter R in
front of the quoted string, and using parentheses inside the string.

So, for example R"(\"\t)" represents the actual string of 4 characters
that appears between the parentheses -- a backslash, a quote, a
backslash, and the letter ``t''.

4.  Regex classes in C++

Consider the example program matchlines.cpp.  It has the following
three declarations:

   regex comment_regex {R"(^\s*(#.*)?$)"};
   regex key_value_regex {R"(^\s*(.*?)\s*=\s*(.*?)\s*$)"};
   regex trimmed_regex {R"(^\s*([^=]+?)\s*$)"};

regex is the data type initialized with the raw strings.  Pattern
matching applies a regular expression to a string and determines a
match.  Regexes are a programming language in themselves.

Dissection of the strings.  In the following each item shows only the
actual regex after the raw string delimiters have been stripped.

 (a) ^\s*(#.*)?$
     Match optional white space, optionally followed by a hash and
     anything that follows it.

     ^    Match the beginning of the string.

     \s*  Match zero or more white space characters.  Backslash
          escapes meta characters and makes ordinary characters have
          special meanings.  \s match white space (spaces, tabs,
          newlines).  The asterisk indicates that the preceding item
          should be recognized zero ore more times.

     (    Begin a capture.  In a regex_search, this will be an element
          of the result vector.

     #.*  Match the hash (literally), followed by zero or more of
          anything.  A dot (.) matches any characters except a
          newline, and (.*) matches zero or more of any character.

     )?   End the capture and place it into the result.  The question
          mark indicates that the preceding capture is optional.

     $    Match the end of the string.

 (b) ^\s*(.*?)\s*=\s*(.*?)\s*$
     Match any sequence of characters preceding an equal sign (=) and
     then also after the equal sign, capturing sequences befoe and
     after it.  In each sequence white space is trimmed fore and aft.

     ^    Beginning of line.

     \s*  Zero or more white space.

     (.*?) Match and capture any sequence of zero or more characters.
          Non-greedy (lazy) matching, as few as possible.

     .*   would mean a greedy match, but

     .*?  is a lazy match, which matches as few characters as
          possible.

     \s*  Zero or more white space.

     =    Match an equal sign.

     \s*  Zero or more white space.

     (.*?) As above, the second captured match.  Parentheses indicate
          a capture.  Non-greedy matching of zero or more characters.

     \s*  Zero or more white space.

     $    End of line.

 (c) ^\s*([^=]+?)\s*$
     Match a line containing a sequence of one or more characters none
     of which is an equal sign.

     ^    Beginnng of line.

     \s*  White space.

     ([^=]+?) Capture what is in the parentheses.  Brackets indicate a
          set of characters, in this case the character equal sign.
          The circumflex (hat) complements the set.  So

     [^=] matches any character not an equal sign.

     [^=]+ matches one or more such characters.

     [^=]+? matches one or more such characters, but in a non-greedy
          (lazy) manner, matching as few as possible.

     \s*  White space.

     $    End of line.

5.  Usage of regex

The regex variables declared above are used in the example program
matchlines.cpp.  Part of the code follows.

 (a) string line;
     smatch result;
     An smatch variable holds the result of a regex match, and is used
     to store the results of a search.  Each pair of parentheses in
     the regex will capture a matched result.
         result[0] represents the entire matched expression
         result[i] represents sub-expression i that has been matched.

 (b) if (regex_search (line, result, comment_regex)) {
     Search the line to see if it matches the comment regex.  If so,
     we can ignore the line because comments are not data.  regex_
     search returns true if the match has succeeded.

 (c) }else if (regex_search (line, result, key_value_regex)) {
     Search the line for a key value pair.  This regex has two
     captures.  If the match succeeds, the smatch result variable has
     two values in it.  At this point:
         result[1] has the key (first captured string)
         result[2] has the value (second captured string)

 (d) }else if (regex_search (line, result, trimmed_regex)) {
     Search the line for the trimmed regex (the third alternative).
     This is the query for the program.
         result[1] has the value of the query string that was
          captured.

 (e) }else { assert(false) ...
     This can't happen if the three regexes are exhaustive.  But an
     assert(false) just does a backup check to make sure the program
     crashes if the logic is wrong.
