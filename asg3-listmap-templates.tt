1.  Overview

In this assignment, you will implement template code and not use any
template classes from the standard library.  You will also write your
own code to handle files.  Refer to the earlier assignment as to how
to open and read files.

You may use the following includes, and if you think anything else is
needed, post a question to the discussion forum:  <cassert>, <cerrno>,
<cstdlib>, <cstring>, <exception>, <fstream>, <iomanip>, <iostream>,
<regex>, <stdexcept>, <string>, <typeinfo>.

Specifically, you may not use any classes that take template
parameters, such as <iterator>, <list>, <map>, <pair>, <vector>,
except for those you write yourself.  Do not use shared_ptr, and
instead, explicitly manage pointers yourself using new and delete.
Ensure that there are no dangling pointers and no memory leak.  Use
valgrind to check on this.

2.  Program specification

The program is specified in the format of a Unix man(1) page.

NAME
     keyvalue -- manage a list of key and value pairs

SYNOPSIS
     keyvalue [-@ flags] [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     Input is read from each file in turn.  Before any processing,
     each input line is echoed to cout, preceded by its filename and
     line number within the file.  The name of cin is printed as a
     minus sign (-).

OPTIONS
     The -@ option is followed by a sequence of flags to enable
     debugging output, which is written to the standard error.  The
     option flags are only meaningful to the programmer.

OPERANDS
     Each operand is the name of a file to be read.  If no filenames
     are specified, cin is read.  If filenames are specified, a
     filename consisting of a single minus sign (-) causes cin to be
     read in sequence at that position.  Any file that can not be
     accessed causes a message in proper format to be printed to cerr.

INPUT DESCRIPTION
     Each non-comment line causes some action on the part of the
     program.  Before processing a command, leading and trailing white
     space is trimmed off of the key and off of the value.  White
     space interior to the key or value is not trimmed.  When a key
     and value pair is printed, the equivalent of the format string
     used is "%s = %s\n".  Use <iostream>, not <stdio>.  The newline
     character is removed from any input line before processing.  If
     there is more than one equal sign on the line, the first
     separates the key from the value, and the rest are part of the
     value.  Input lines are one of the following:

     #
          Any input line whose first non-whitespace character is a
          hash (#) is ignored as a comment.  This means that no key
          can begin with a hash.  An empty line or a line consisting
          of nothing but white space is ignored.

     key
          A line consisting of at least one non-whitespace character
          and no equal sign causes the key and value pair to be
          printed.  If not found, the message
               key: key not found
          is printed.  Note that the characters in italics are not
          printed exactly.  The actual key is printed.  This message
          is printed to cout.

     key =
          If there is only whitespace after the equal sign, the key
          and value pair is deleted from the map.

     key = value
          If the key is found in the map, its value field is replaced
          by the new value.  If not found, the key and value are
          inserted in increasing lexicographic order, sorted by key.
          The new key and value pair is printed.

     =
          All of the key and value pairs in the map are printed in
          lexicographic order.

     = value
          All of the key and value pairs with the given value are
          printed in lexicographic order sorted by key.

EXIT STATUS

     0    No errors were found.

     1    There were some problems accessing files, and error messages
          were reported to cerr.

3.  Reference implementation.

Study the behavior of misc/pkeyvalue.perl, whose behavior your program
should emulate.  The Perl version does not support the debug option of
your program.

4.  Implementation sequence

Consider this implementation sequence, but you may of course choose to
implement your program in a different order.

 (a) Implement your main program whose name is main.cpp, and handle
     files in the same way as the sample Perl code.  Instead of trying
     to use a map, just print debug statements showing which of the
     five kinds of statements are recognized, printing out the key and
     value portion of the statement.

 (b) Instead of <pair> from the standard library, you will use xpair.

 (c) You will be using a linear linked list to implement your data
     structure.  This is obviously unacceptable in terms of a real
     data structures problem, since unit operations will run in $ O (
     n ) $ time instead of the proper $ O ( log sub 2 n ) $ time for a
     balanced binary search tree.  But iteration over a binary search
     tree is rather complex and will not contribute to your learning
     about how to implement templates.

 (d) Look at xless.h and misc/testxless.cpp, which show how to create
     and use an xless object to make comparisons.  The listmap class
     assumes this has already been declared.

 (e) The files *.tcc are explicit template instantiations.  Templates
     are type-safe macros and the source is needed at the point where
     they are compiled.

 (f) For the two queries requiring iteration, your main module must
     make use of the listmap iterators.  Do not copy anything from the
     listmap into another data structure, such as a vector.  That is,
     there may be no function of listmap which copies out all of the
     items into another data structure.

5.  The main function

Replace the code in the main function to do options analysis.  Then,
for each input line, use regex_search using regular expressions to
parse the line into one of the three kinds of lines described above.
Use the field captures to extract the key and value fields.  See the
example matchlines.cpp, which shows how to use regular expressions
from the <regex> library.

6.  Template class listmap

We now examine the class listmap, which is partially implemented for
you.  You need not implement functions that are never called.

 (a) template <typename key_t, typename mapped_t,
               class less_t=xless<key_t>>
     class listmap
     defines the template class with three arguments.  key_t and
     mapped_t are the elements to be kept in the list.  less_t is the
     class used to determine the ordering of the list and defaults to
     xless<key_t>.

 (b) using key_type = key_t;
     using mapped_type = mapped_t;
     using value_type = xpair<const key_type, mapped_type>;
     are some standard names given to usual standard library types.
     Note that the value type is an xpair, not what is normally
     thought as the value, which here is called the mapped type.

 (c) struct link
     represents the list itself and is contained in every node.  The
     list is kept as a circular doubly linked list with the list
     itself being the start and end, as well as the end() result.  In
     a list with $n$ nodes, there are $n + 1$ links, each node having
     a link, and the list itself having a link, but not node values.

 (d) struct node
     is a private node used to hold a value type along with forward
     and backword links to form a doubly linked list.  It inherits
     from struct link.  The private function anchor() downcasts from a
     link to a node.

 (e) listmap();
     listmap (const listmap&);
     listmap& operator= (const listmap&);
     listmap (listmap&&);
     listmap& operator= (listmap&&);
     ~listmap();
     The usual six members are overriden and explicitly defined.

 (f) iterator insert (const value_type&);
     Note that insertion takes a pair as a single argument.  If the
     key is already there, the value is replaced, otherwise there is a
     new entry inserted into the list.  An iterator pointing at the
     inserted item is returned.

     Algorithm:
       1. Chase down the list from begin until you find either end or
          a node with a key not less than the key you are searching
          for.  Always use xless for comparisons.
       2. If you hit end, insert in front of end.
       3. Use xless with the operands reversed.
             If they are equal, replace the value.
             If not, insert the new node in front of the node just
              found.
     You may only use xless to compare keys.  Do not use any
     relational operator.  If xless(a,b) and xless(b,a) are both
     false, that tells you they are equal.

 (g) iterator find (const key_type&);
     Searches and returns an iterator.  If find fails, it returns the
     end() iterator.

     As with insert, use only xless for comparisons.  Do not use ==,
     <, or other comparison operators on strings.

 (h) iterator erase (iterator position);
     The item pointed at by the argument iterator is deleted from the
     list.  The returned iterator points at the position immediately
     following that which was erased.

     An attempt to erase using an invalid iterator (including such as
     end) causes undefined behavior.  Undefined behavior may corrupt
     memory, cause a segmentation fault, or cause other misery.

 (i) iterator begin();
     iterator end();
     The usual iterator generators.  We don't bother here with a
     constant iterator.  Since the list is circular, end() is just the
     list itself.

7.  Template class listmap::iterator

Although the iterator is nested inside the list map, it is easier to
read when specified separately.  Using erase, operator->, or operator*
on an invalid iterator (including end) causes undefined behavior.
Undefined means that anything can happen.  It is the programmer's
responsibility not to cause undefined behavior.

 (a) class listmap<key_t,mapped_t,less_t>::iterator
     specifies precisely which class the iterator belongs to.

 (b) friend class listmap<key_t,mapped_t>;
     Only a listmap is permitted to construct a valid iterator.

 (c) iterator (node* where);
     The iterator keeps track of the node.

 (d) value_type& operator*();
     Returns a reference to some value type (key and value pair) in
     the list.  Selections are then by dot (.).

 (e) value_type* operator->();
     Returns a pointer to some value type, from which fields can be
     selected with an arrow (->).

 (f) iterator& operator++(); //++itor
     iterator& operator--(); //--itor
     Move backwards and forwards along the list.  Moving off the end
     with ++ and moving from an end iterator to the last element does
     not require special coding, since the list is a circular list.
     We don't bothere here with the postfix operators.

 (g) void erase();
     Removes the key and value pair from the list.
